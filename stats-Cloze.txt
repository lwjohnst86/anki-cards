A {{c1::coefficient (or parameter)}} is the multiplication variable or value.;

The form {{c1::[$]Y = X\beta + e[/$]}} is the simplest form of the ordinary least squares regression.;

The assumptions for linear regression are 1) constant variance (homoscedasticity) of the error terms independent of the predictors (equal distribution of the residuals around the regression line; examine the fitted vs residuals plot); 2) the outcome variable displays a linear relationship with the exposure variables (not a strong assumption); 3) normally distributed residuals (indicates linearity), 2) values are independent o;
